QUICK FIX FOR INSTALLATION ISSUE
================================

Your device is detected but installation fails. Here's the solution:

STEP 1: UNINSTALL OLD VERSION (MOST IMPORTANT!)
------------------------------------------------
On your phone:
1. Go to Settings → Apps
2. Search for "annadaan"
3. If you find it, tap it and UNINSTALL
4. This is usually why installation fails!

STEP 2: ENABLE USB INSTALLATION
--------------------------------
On your phone:
1. Settings → Developer Options
2. Enable "Install via USB" (if available)
3. Enable "USB Debugging (Security settings)"

STEP 3: TRY INSTALLATION AGAIN
-------------------------------
Run: flutter run

OR manually install:
1. Copy this file to your phone:
   build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk
2. On phone: Open the APK file
3. Tap "Install"

STEP 4: IF STILL FAILS
----------------------
Check your phone screen - there might be a popup asking for permission.
Look for any error messages on the phone screen.

The APK file is ready at:
build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk

Transfer it to your phone and install manually if Flutter install fails.
